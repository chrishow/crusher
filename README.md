# The Crusher

Compresses video files for use on web


## Install

Download the latest .dmg release from:

https://github.com/chrishow/crusher/releases

It's huge, I know. This is due to it being an Electron app, and having a statically compiled build of FFmepg embedded in it. 


Double-click the downloaded file.
